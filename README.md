**Abstract**:
Dynamic cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) provides time-resolved visualization of respiratory motion, which is crucial for precise target localization in lung radiotherapy. However, reconstructing each motion state from one angular sampling remains a severely ill-posed problem. While recent implicit neural representation (INR) methods have shown promise in modeling continuous spatiotemporal scenes, they are often computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic CBCT reconstruction framework, Motion-Aware Gaussian splatting In dynamic CBCT imaging (MAGIC), for high-quality and efficient reconstruction. Instead of implicit neural networks, MAGIC represents the dynamic scene using learnable Gaussian primitives, which significantly reduces reconstruction time and maintains representation flexibility. We introduce a motion-aware decomposition (MADE) module for Gaussians to decouple static anatomical components and motion variations. The decomposition allows the network to focus its capacity on the deformation of dynamic regions, facilitating more accurate motion modeling. Furthermore, we design a respiratory deformation network (RED) with a Deca-Planes encoder to effectively capture inter- and intra-cycle similarities from quasi-periodic respiration. Experiments on simulated data, a physical phantom and clinical lung CBCT datasets demonstrate that MAGIC substantially accelerates reconstruction compared to INR-based methods while achieving superior image quality and motion fidelity. These results indicate that MAGIC offers an efficient and effective alternative for dynamic CBCT reconstruction in respiration-related radiotherapy.
